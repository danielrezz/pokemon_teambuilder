<h2>
    Summary
</h2>

<p>
     The Pokémon Team Builder is a web application that allows you to search for any Pokémon (currently only 1st gen) and access their stats, add them to a team, and compare your team with other players.

<p>
    The Pokémon Team Builder was built using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. It utilizes the CSS framework, Bulma, and was also built with jQuery. Upon search of a Pokémon, data is pulled from the PokeAPI, which you can find at https://pokeapi.co/.

<h2>
    Content
</h2>

<p>
    As soon as you access the PTB, you will find yourself on the home page where you are presented with a search bar. In this search bar, you can currently search for any first-gen Pokémon by name and you will be presented with that Pokémon's stats, much like the information a Pokédex will provide you. If you like what you see, you can click "Add to Team" and that Pokémon will appear in a column on the right. You can select up to 6 Pokémon.
  <br>
    Other features include a link to PokéTV where you can watch episodes of Pokémon, as well as the PokéGIF Generator, which generates random Pokémon GIFs.

<h2>
    Challenges
</h2>

<p>
    Aside from the challenge of working on our new skills as new developers, the biggest challenge we faced as a team would have to be sorting out tasks to each team member. We had a small setback after losing one of our team members and had to pick up some pieces to make up for lost time/work.
  <br>
    We also continued to struggle with saving data to local storage, which would allow users to access saved information even upon a page refresh.
